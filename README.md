# Code for analysis and visualization in the DGN paper
+ The `coexpression_characteristics.py` script corresponds to the analysis of gene co-expression network characteristics in the paper (Fig. 2).
+ The `associated_cell_types.py` script corresponds to the analysis of phenotype-associated cell types in the paper (Fig. 3a-b).
+ The `associated_genes.py` script corresponds to the analysis of phenotype-associated genes in the paper (Fig. 3c-e).
+ The `associated_gene_modules.py` script corresponds to the analysis of phenotype-associated gene network modules in the paper (Fig. 4-5, and Table 1).
+ The `case_analysis.py` script corresponds to the analysis of gene networks under disease conditions in the paper (Fig. 6).
+ The `compare_DESE.py` script corresponds to the comparative analysis between DGN and DESE in the paper.
+ The `pare.py` script contains parameter settings used in the analysis.
+ The `util.py` script contains utility functions that are dependencies for the analysis.
